Large waves have broken a buoy off its moorings.  Use your handy supply of depth charges to blast it back out to sea.

Controls: UP and DOWN arrow to move the depth charge.  Hold SPACE bar to charge the throw distance of the depth charge.  When it is underwater, press SPACE again to detonate

Also works with a controller and the A button
